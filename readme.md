# bibcon

The purpose of *bibcon* (BibTeX condenser) is to extract all references cited in Quarto / RMarkdown documents from a main BibTeX library to a "condensed" BibTeX file.

This is a fast (and functioning) reimplementation of [condensebib](https://github.com/andybega/condensebib) by Andreas Beger.

Please pay attention that this software is called *bibcon*, not *Bitcoin*.
